Introduction
------------

These slides show an example of using slidify to create a set of html slides for a course project on statistical network models

Note that I had some issues with slidify, specifically
- I couldn't stop output from a call to plot.fv from showing up in the slides
- I couldn't get slidify to recognize one of my slides as being a new slide

Because of these two issues, I had to do some manual reconfiguring of the index.html page, so what you get from knitting the .Rmd page won't be exactly what
you get from index.html.  I thus have a copy called final_pres.html, which is what I presented

Hope this is useful to someone!
